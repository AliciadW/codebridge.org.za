          <p>Once a year the global open data community dedicates a day to spreading the love around open data in the form of International <a href="http://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day</a>. It’s all about introducing people to what <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/">open data</a> is, showing the value of it and how it can be used to <a href="http://code4sa.org/2014/04/25/generic-medicines-ftw.html">make a difference on a daily basis</a> and generally <a href="http://code4sa.org/2017/02/16/interesting-explorations-of-the-medical-profession.html">having fun and learning</a> with data.

          <h2 class="odd17-title" id="thechallenge">The Challenge</h2>
          <p>How well does your municipality manage its budget? How many months cash runway do they have in the bank?
