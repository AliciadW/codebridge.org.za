<p>South Africa is in the grip of the worst drought in a century, according to The South African Weather Service. Farmers and citizens across the country are struggling to get access to enough water. Crops are failing, livestock are dying and entire communities do not have enough water to survive. The result is that food prices are skyrocketing due to dwindling supply of local produce and staples like maize and wheat are having to be imported at a huge cost.</p>

<p>The DWS is raising awareness of our country’s water and sanitation issues, exploring the problem space and digging into potential solutions by running a multi-event campaign.</p>

<p>First and foremostly we needed to ensure that the problem space was sufficiently  understood and problems correctly framed. With this in mind we hosted an unconference at the beginning of March.</p>

<p>This event was aimed at bringing together representatives from government, industry, technology startups, civil society, academia, and the media to unpack the challenges faced by South Africans with regards to water and sanitation.</p>

<p>The outputs of the conference have been summarised into the following categories. When thinking about your potential water solution, use these categories to help get some more direction.</p>

<h4>Outputs from Unconference</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>How do we enable water source diversification</b> - how to shift the emphasis toward saving, local harvesting and ownership instead of waste reduction?
<li><b>How can we build more responsive, inclusive and accurate information and control systems</b>  through decentralized and open engagement within communities.
<li><b>What alternatives are there for water infrastructure development and associated financing models</b> - We need alternative water infrastructure financing and billing models including leveraging government grants with other funds, and decentralised financing/payment options.
<li><b>How do we support innovation and adoption of emerging technologies </b> - Coordinated effort to address technical issues around possible high-impact solutions and speed-up adoption of new technologies. Develop platforms and processes to manage risk and change perceptions of new technologies in engineering communities.
<li><b>How can we encourage change by big water users</b> (especially in agriculture)?
<li><b>How do we encourage water reuse through better partnerships (especially civil society)</b> - Change perceptions and implement novel solutions around water reuse.
<li><b>How to support innovation and manufacturing by small entrepreneurs along water value chain</b> - Identify opportunities for water innovation and collaboration with local government – by small businesses, citizens, local manufacturing, etc.
<li><b>How do we support inclusive community action and partnership (instead of just creating awareness about water use)</b> - Strong leadership enabling more diverse community forums, ownership and action around water.
<li><b>How do we support development of mid-level water careers</b> - transition from entry-level positions, visibility of job opportunities, mentoring and facilitate transfer of knowledge from retiring skills.
