  title: Shop local
  excerpt: This is a story about localisation, entrepreneurship and investment in the future of our country’s small businesses. It is also about opportunity, overcoming political disruptions and prejudices; told through the eyes of the people of Durban’s city centre.
  body: <p>The The Shop Local &#35;CBStoryChallenge team is made up of a couple of economists, who are passionate about community led initiatives to improve our lives, preserve our natural environment, protect our vulnerable citizens and push towards a better future for all in Durban, and beyond.</p><p>Our story is about localisation, and small business development. We believe that when people support local businesses, they invest in the future of their neighbourhood by enabling small businesses to grow, creating local employment opportunities, fostering a culture of innovation and creativity as well as striving towards the vision of eThekwini as Africa’s most caring and livable city. While we know that large businesses employ lots f people, and offer competitive prices on many goods and services, we think that the benefits of growing local businesses outweigh these savings and provide an opportunity for individuals to start new businesses, and seek out meaningful employment opportunities, creating more employment, and a community that enjoys shared success. We believe that small businesses are more likely to invest in their surroundings, by upgrading parks and street furniture, attracting visitors to the area, and maintaining exciting shared spaces for residents and visitors.</p><p>People should care because our communities have been disrupted and destroyed by our politics and prejudices. We build walls around ourselves and welcome malls and supermarkets into our neighbourhoods, creating a hostile environment for small businesses, artists and traders to make a living and contribute to local character. We don’t know our neighbours, and they don’t know us. Humans are social beings, we thrive in close knit communities, where we are able to help and support one another.Shop Local &#35;CBStoryChallenge team is made up of a couple of economists, who are passionate about community led initiatives to improve our lives, preserve our natural environment, protect our vulnerable citizens and push towards a better future for all in Durban, and beyond.</p><div class="col-xs-6 sdcu1-left"><img class="ctupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/shop-local-1.1.jpg"></div><p>Our story is about localisation, and small business development.

We have decided to focus on Glenwood and hope that in the future, our platform could be expanded, or duplicated in other areas. Our first task will be to map visible businesses and facilities in the area, by having fieldworkers, familiar with the area, record the names and, if available, main activities, on a map. We understand that not all products and services are going to be available in Glenwood, but we think that there are probably more options that people are aware of, and we’d like to show that J The next step will be to categorise businesses based on the goods r services on offer – hair salons, stationery, groceries, entertainment etc. We’d like to then approach 1 or two from each category and ask them to tell us about their businesses. Key areas of interest will be use local suppliers; size of business (employees); key activities etc. We’d like to understand how small businesses in our area operate so that we can help consumers, like us, and others, to make informed decisions, and hopefully, given the relevant information, will shift some proportion of their spending towards local businesses.</p>
