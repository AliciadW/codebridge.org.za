  title: Food Security and Environmental Justice in the spotlight this weekend in Durban
  excerpt: This past weekend was a busy one, with World Food Day-related events happening all over Durban. The Green Camp team attended three days of talks and events held by the various social and environmental groups around the city.
  body: <p>The Green Camp Gallery is about food security, care of the environment and grassroots action to counteract the increasing power and influence of biotech and GMO companies such as Monsanto, DuPont and Bayer. In the context of the World Food Day this past weekend has been a busy one for ACTivism in Durban, with three days of talks and events held by the various social and environmental groups around the city. We, therefore, decided to devote this week’s content to the happenings and event of the past weekend.</p><img class="stupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/green-camp-2.1.jpg"><p>On Friday there was a press conference organised by the KZN Environmental Network (KEN), whose member groups include South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA), groundWork (Friends of the Earth South Africa), Earthlife Africa Durban, Timberwatch, Biowatch, SAFCEI, and Greenpeace among other groups.<p>The main purpose of the network is to focus on the myriad environmental issues that connect us all and provide present community perspectives around water and sanitation, energy, food, land and waste.</p><p>This was followed by a ‘People’s Assembly’ on Saturday at the Durban University of Technology, named “Seeds of Our Struggle.” Affected communities of Durban and KZN gave testimonies as to the ongoing struggles they face on a daily basis, namely climate change, air quality, health, energy, livelihoods, development and food production etc.</p><p>Definition:<i>A popular assembly (or people's assembly) is a gathering called to address issues of importance to participants. Assemblies tend to be freely open to participation and operate by direct democracy, and to form an alternative power structure when participants feel the effects of a democratic deficit in a representative democratic systems.</i></p><p>Discussions focussed around solutions and fresh ways to combine and realign forces against an economic system that puts corporate profits before people and planet.</p><img class="stupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/green-camp-2.2.jpg"><p>A Day of Solutions concluded the weekend at Chatsworth’s Nelson Mandela Youth Centre, in celebration of the Global World Food Day and to mark the end of the ‘Monsanto Tribunal’.</p><p>The three-day symbolic "moral trial" was arranged by an international coalition of rights and environmental groups and includes people's assemblies in The Hague and around the globe.</p><p>US seed developer and biotech company Monsanto is facing charges related to “ecocide” in a symbolic trial being staged by anti-GM food activists in The Hague. The tribunal comes as Monsanto edges closer to a $66 billion deal with German chemical giant Bayer, to form the largest GMO and pesticide company in the world, dubbed a merger from hell.</p><h4>Dr Vandana Shiva opens the People's Assembly</h4><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7AqGr1HA_DY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><img class="stupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/green-camp-2.3.jpg"><p>The trial also coincides with the release of a scathing new report which claims that it's not just Monsanto's products that have been harmful, but also that the biotech giant's political influence and lobbying efforts have contributed to a global erosion of democracy, environmental chaos and social injustice.</p><p><i>"This tribunal might not be legally binding, but it will highlight the urgent need for similar legal mechanisms to hold corporations accountable for the damage they cause in the pursuit of profit,"</i> said ‘Global Justice Now’ food campaigner Heidi Chow in a statement.</p><p>The Monsanto Tribunal will hold Monsanto & Co. accountable for their crimes against humanity, human rights violations and ecocide, no matter what name and form they morph into.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><img class="stupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/green-camp-2.4.jpg"></div><div class="col-sm-6"><img class="ctupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/green-camp-2.5.jpg"><p><small>Green Camp’s Xolani Hlongwa and Åsa Nilsson (front centre), attending the World Food Day celebration at Chatsworth Youth Centre. Photo&#58; Angus Joseph.</small></p></div></div><p>“This event evolved to become a networking gathering for people passionate about food security and social justice. There were demos with some lively discussions around how to induce the Youth Centre into a Permaculture hub, identifying the root causes of food inequality, and visioning around increasing food security in Durban /South Africa, all while presenting some solutions and celebrating each other.</p><p>We enjoyed the sun and the rain, had a tree-mendous meditation session, chatted about seeds and seedbanks and circular economies, saw the proof-of-concept for the juicycle, learned some tricks around making banana jam, shared some ingredients on non-toxic body products and a wonderful picnic in the amphitheatre.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fflsa.org/">Food for Life</a> crew dropped by on their rounds with some of their yummy vegan food, to go with the cassava and beans and stew. Thanks to all those that made the journey, it was a great day. To those that wished to be involved but couldn't make it, let’s make another one in the future.”</p>

  title: Fixing broken windows
  excerpt: By depicting the work, challenges and rewards of the inhabitants and volunteers of the Green Camp Gallery Project, Vanessa and Qudisa aim to inspire and empower other communities to take it upon themselves to 'fix more broken windows' by transforming similar places into spaces of creativity, hope and abundance.
  body: <p>Both being Durbanites who had spent more than a decade away from home, Vanessa and Qudisa - team Green Camp of the &#35;CBStoryChallenge - became acutely aware of the negative changes that had occurred, when they returned. They decided that they wanted to reconnect and engage with their hometown via community upliftment projects and volunteering.</p><p>We frame our story by means of the ‘broken window’ concept, in the form of a short documentary made up of installments and written content, which goes as follows&#58;</p><p><i>“Consider a dilapidated building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency for vandals is to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it’s unoccupied, squatters move in and light fires inside. This attracts further crime, drugs and prostitution thereby destabilizing the neighbourhood.”</i></p><p>The Green Camp Gallery Project, (246 Umbilo Rd) used to be such a property. However, three years ago Xolani Hlongwa, with the help of a few friends took initiative, cleaned up and restructured the plot and made it a shining example of how creativity, urban farming and social responsibility can positively transform a neighbourhood previously plagued by crime, urban decay and social disintegration.</p><p>An excerpt from their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GreenCampGalleryProject/">Facebook page</a> describes the work they’re doing&#58;</p><p class="piframe"><div class="col-sm-6 sdcu1-right cgiframe"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGreenCampGalleryProject%2Fvideos%2F765088950293305%2F&show_text=0" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></div><i>“A hub of urban farming and green rehabilitated art. Using the materials left over from the house and donated material creating beautiful pieces such as a plant growing in an old shoe. It’s about recycling and rehabilitating old materials so that we show people how they can recycle their ideas, heartaches and challenges and make them useful in life.”</i></p><p>During the project we would like to pose questions, such as&#58;<ul><li>What are the main difficulties/obstacles for initiating and running community upliftment projects?</li><li>Why are there so many prejudices against them?</li><li>How do they bring people together?</li><li>What kind of people are engaging at these places?</li><li>What have been the most rewarding aspects?</li><li>How can the ‘Green Camp’ concept be replicated and what resources are needed?</li><li>What other projects and initiatives exist in Durban and how do they connect?</li></ul><p>By depicting the work, challenges and rewards of the inhabitants and volunteers of the Green Camp Gallery Project, our aim is to inspire and empower other communities to take it upon themselves to 'fix more broken windows' by transforming similar places into spaces of creativity, hope and abundance.</p><p>The GreenCamp &#35;CBStoryChallenge team is comprised of Vanessa Meintjes and Qudsia Mall.</p><p><img class="tsupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/green-camp-1.1.jpg">Vanessa Meintjes is a trained Permaculturalist and a self-taught horticulturalist. She was a goldsmith before gardening found her and told her she had green fingers and a memory for long Latin names, which surprised her no end. When she’s not designing or growing and planting, she plans events to do with growing and planting. She’s also an admin for Permaculture Durban on Facebook, the local “grow your own food brigade.” She works on various consulting projects, has compiled a plant reference guide for use in landscaping and permaculture and is co-author of a chapter on designing food forests in ‘The Durban Forest’ published by the Durban Botanic Gardens Trust.</p><p><img class="tsupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/green-camp-1.2.jpg">Qudsia Mall is an author, adventure sports entrepreneur and motivational speaker. She works with the youth and different faith groups to promote understanding and tolerance in humanity as well as delivering inspiration on self development and encouraging a positive mindset. She's originally from Durban but has lived for 14 years in the UK and Saudi Arabia. She now resides in South Africa where she runs her company 'Nomadic Spirit', is a vegan smoothie lover as well as a die-hard travel junkie.</p>
