  title: Thabile, on a journey to overcome the odds
  excerpt: "As the focus of their story, the team wanted Thabile to tell us a little bit about herself. Here's her story."
  body: <p>Thabile is a student at Mangusuthu University in Umlazi, where she is studying marketing. Alongside her studies, Thabile also interns at a bank nearby and everyday, makes the journey from her university res room to the bank, before returning to study. As you will know from reading a little bit about Thabile in our previous posts, she is completely reliant on a battery-operated wheelchair and makes her daily commute alone, all the while hoping that the batteries don’t run out. She is extremely ambitious and when she graduates, wants to start her own catering business with a friend. Unfortunately Thabile faces opposition from her mother, who does not support her decision to study and work, and has asked her not to return home. This means that she is unsure about where she’ll live once she finished university and is also reluctant to accept the surgery offered to her by her doctor. Despite her waning health and lack of support, she is determined to pursue her dreams.</p><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9HnzHxwGnfhdzZ5T0Yxamhvdms/preview" frameborder='0' width="100%" height="380"></iframe>

  title: The story of a girl overcoming all odds to succeed
  excerpt: "Thabile has, in the past few years, been confined to a wheelchair after being diagnosed with colon cancer. For the &#35;CBStoryChallenge we hope to tell the story of people with disabilities who have, despite their situations, overcoming the odds to succeed."
  body: <p>When I first met Thabile I was shocked at how independent she was. She had no problem doing anything, although confined to a wheelchair. She is in her last year of studying a marketing degree at Mangusuthu University, in Umlazi. Thabile lives in student accommodation on campus and in the mornings, works as an intern at the bank down the road. At the moment, she has an electric wheelchair, but the battery just manages to get her to work and back.</p><p>Life is hard for Thabile, especially since she found out that she has colon cancer several years ago. It has since worsened, which is why she is now confined to a wheelchair.  We all face pressure on a daily basis, but hers are far greater than most. But that doesn’t stop her from trying and in fact, only makes her more driven to achieve her dreams.</p><p>She is one of the most inspiring people you will ever meet, with a beautiful enquiring mind. Thabile’s passion and drive are second to none.</p><div class="col-xs-4 sdcu1-left"><img class="ctupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/overcoming-the-odds-1.1.jpg"><i>Bradley Downs</i></div><div class="col-xs-4 sdcu1-left"><img class="ctupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/overcoming-the-odds-1.2.jpg"><i>Jed Kenny</i></div><div class="col-xs-4 sdcu1-left"><img class="ctupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/overcoming-the-odds-1.3.jpg"><i>Mildred Ncgobo</i></div><p>For the &#35;CBStoryChallenge, we are making a documentary that will look at what it’s like for people with disabilities, through the eyes of Thabile.</p><p>We can’t wait for people to see this video documenting her day-to-day life, as we believe her story will inspire people in the same way it inspired us. We will show her experiences from the moment she wakes up and gets ready for work in the morning, to returning home to study, spend time with friends and family. We will also show what it’s like for those around her to interact with a woman as driven and determined as Thabile, despite everything she’s been and is going through. For us, a big reason for wanting to make this video is because so often the people who are looked to as role models somehow seem bigger than ‘ordinary’ people, because of how they are depicted, and we forget that actually, that’s exactly what they are&#58; ordinary people, just like you and I. It’s time to a real life hero take the stage.</p><p>We are also hoping that our telling of Thabile’s story will encourage people to help her in some way or another.</p><p>Our team consists of three people&#58; Bradley Downs, who will be managing the project, doing some camerawork and editing the documentary. Jed Kenny, a photographer, will be leading on the camerawork, lighting and editing. Mildred Ncgobo, who fostered Thabile before she went to university, will be doing the translations and assisting overall. We’re excited to have such a dynamic team and with the help of Mildred, who is a huge inspiration herself, hope to affect change within Thabile’s life - and other people in similar situations to hers.</p>
