  title: Fines, violent strikes or safer taxi stops?
  excerpt: Safer Taxi Stops is a project aimed at improving the public transport system, with a focus on Durban taxi drivers and riders. This team of public transport enthusiasts will tell the story of what it means to be a taxi driver in this system&#58; fines, violent strikes and difficult customers.
  body: <p>Safer Taxi Stops is a project that aims to provide commuters, government leaders and taxi drivers with a useful guide on safe places to pick up and drop off passengers in the city of Durban while putting a human face to taxi drivers who are often only featured in the media when they down tools and violently hold the city to ransom over fine disputes with metro police.</p><p>We plan to tell the story of taxi drivers who are fined to the hilt for stopping illegally around town because there are insufficient legal safe places for them to stop at the roadside. However, they can’t afford to pay these exorbitant fines on their paltry wages, sometimes as low as R100 a day, while other taxi drivers hire their vehicles from taxi owners and have to earn their income through servicing as many customers as possible each day which comes with its own problems. These fines pile up and the city’s metro police department then starts pulling over and impounding vehicles when drivers’ refuse to pay, resulting in prolonged strikes every couple of years that have a ripple effect on passengers and the entire local economy which loses millions of rands in lost productivity.</p><p>Durban’s taxi drivers might stop hundreds of times a day to pick up or drop off passengers. They stop at traffic lights, bus stops, on the highway, in the taxi rank and sometimes in the middle of the road. If we look through their eyes, what do we see? Who are they? How do their days on the road look like? What pressures and challenges guide their behaviour? What infrastructure do they find on their route? Where are they allowed to stop? Where do they need to stop? What makes them stop in dangerous places?</p><p>We want to get to know three taxi drivers and tell their story in words, but also with data. Recording their daily life in the taxi, from the amount of traffic lights they pass to the passengers they carry and the litres of petrol consumed daily, might help us to understand and develop tools to allow others to see their perspective.</p><p>Mapping the drivers’ routes allows us to identify problem areas and safe zones to stop. We want to process these maps so that they can be used as a negotiating tool for safer taxi stops, for example when discussing public transport infrastructure with the city, or when educating their passengers on designated spots to alight from or enter a taxi. These maps can be physically placed in taxis and displayed online.</p><p>Perhaps, if there were maps of safe places to stop that could be placed in taxis and handed to passengers, as well as presented online, then drivers would have a clear guide to be able to advise passengers that they will no longer stop wherever convenient, and illegally, for them at the side of the road. Passenger resistance to safer stops has been a problem for taxi drivers who have expressed interest in such maps.</p><p>We plan to gather data on existing routes and stops and to interview taxi drivers, commuters, city planners, metro police, motorists, taxi owners and taxi conductors during the course of the project.</p><h4>Our Team</h4><b>Abigail Kemper</b><p>Abigail Kemper (née Knox) is cofounder of TaxiMap, a social enterprise start-up, providing information on minibus taxi routes, fare prices and hours of operation to all commuters. Other than by word of mouth, this information has never before been available or accessible to people who travel by minibus taxis in South Africa. Based in Durban, Abigail is also sole proprietor of Three Consulting. Like the triple bottom line (people, planet and profit) there are three elements that define and underpin her work&#58; energy, environment and people. Her work involves multi-disciplinary research and project management in the fields of sustainable energy, informality, economic development and the green economy. She is a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Cape Town.</p><b>Lyse Comins</b><p>Lyse Comins (née Ramos) is a South African journalist and media consultant who writes regular consumer columns for Independent Media (The Post) and Media 24 (The Witness) and contributes news stories and features regularly to titles including Freight and Trading Weekly, Sunday Tribune, The Post and Daily News. She is a media consultant to the largest privately owned armed response company in the country, Blue Security. She was previously editor of Consumer Fair and worked as a staff reporter at Daily News, The Mercury and Independent on Saturday. Her articles have also been published in The Star, Cape Times, Pretoria News, Zululand Observer, Cape Argus and Leadership. Lyse is based in Durban and studying towards a Master’s of Technology Degree in Journalism at the Durban University of Technology. She loves working with people and she is passionate about human and consumer rights and seeing the watchdog role of the media fulfilled.</p><b>Maria Schuld</b><img class="tsupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/safer-taxi-stops-1.1.jpg"><p>Maria Schuld is originally from Germany and decided many years ago to make the beautiful city of Durban her new home. She is about to finish her PhD in a rather curious discipline called quantum machine learning, which is a mixture of machine learning and quantum theory. She loves science for constantly challenging her understanding of the world and its internal structures and is eager to share this passion with like-minded people around her. To this end Maria founded the Hawu! Science Outreach Initiative, which received the Outreach Startup award from the German Academic Foundation in 2015. She is also a mentor in the Bright Stars Mentorship programme since 2014 and a dedicated surfer and dancer.</p><b>Mark Fingerhuth</b><img class="tsupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/safer-taxi-stops-1.2.jpg"><p>Mark Fingerhuth is from Germany but feels much more at home when traveling and living abroad. He is about to finish his BSc in Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Maastricht, The Netherlands. His passions range from theoretical physics and programming to sustainability and he is currently writing his thesis in the field of quantum machine learning. In the beginning of 2016 he co-founded the web design company Macademia, which primarily develops websites for social entrepreneurs and NGOs. When not working, you will either find him cooking fancy meals in the kitchen, meditating near a waterfall or learning to surf on Durban's beautiful waves.</p>
