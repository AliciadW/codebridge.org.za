  title: What would you do with your last drop?
  excerpt: The KayaFM &#35;CBStoryChallenge team is on a mission to jolt South Africans out of our apathy towards water conservation, and through innovative storytelling, plans to tell the water story in a way that will create measurable impact.
  body: <p>Water Wars! The idea seems so far- fetched, fantastical and somewhat melodramatic. It immediately evokes a detached perception of a world far, far away that exists only in our imaginations.</p><p>The drought in sub-Saharan Africa is far from far, far away and yet recent revelations by South Africa’s Water and Sanitations Minister Nomvula Mokhonyane, paints a picture of a country that is yet to realise and internalise the true extent of this country’s - and the continent’s - national disaster. Last week, after hosting an urgent meeting with all mayors in Gauteng, Mokhonyane told a small group of media that the province was using more water, rather than saving the 15% now required from municipalities in the province. Mokhonyane said that the country has reached a point of no return and further failure to save water will inevitably result in the collapse of the Vaal Water System, come January 2017. Interestingly, Gauteng, which depends on other provinces for water, has only managed to declare a 2% saving of water. Urban dwellers in the city are said to use 40% of their drinkable water on non-consumptive uses such as gardening, car washing and beautification. It is unfathomable how, despite dam levels reaching historic lows and very little rain expected, we continue to go about business as usual.</p><div class="col-xs-4 sdcu1-left"><img class="ctupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/water-wars-1.1.jpg"><i>Tunicia Phillips</i></div><div class="col-xs-4 sdcu1-left"><img class="ctupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/water-wars-1.3.jpg"><i>Ntombentle Mcasa</i></div><div class="col-xs-4 sdcu1-left"><img class="ctupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/water-wars-1.2.jpg"><i>Nhlanhla Sehume</i></div><p>The KayaFM &#35;CBStoryChallenge team is on a mission to jolt South Africans out of our apathy. Through innovative technologies and ideas, we plan to tell the water story in a way that will create measurable impact. This is by no means an easy task. We hope to spearhead water saving initiatives through a mobile phone application and to engage with the challenges that define our cultural disposition in urban areas, which have rendered our proactive abilities for this cause, paralysed. By sharing the brutal truths and, to a certain extent, the potential for inevitable war for water, we seek to, in a way, shock people into action while also rewarding citizens who are changing their behaviour and innovatively saving our most important natural resource.</p><p>Throughout this campaign, our coverage will explore the role of various sectors like mining in the management of water use; the private sector in innovating water saving technologies and the dire effect the current drought has had on food security and the agricultural sector. With the use of data analysis and infographics, the content will uncover the history and current trends of water supply and use within various regions. We look forward to rewarding innovative and dedicated ordinary people who have gone the extra mile to do their part for the preservation of Africa’s new gold.</p>
