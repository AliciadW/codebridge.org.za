  title: Conversation catalysts for the preservation of sanitary dignity
  excerpt: Chani and Tim, who refer to themselves as “conversation catalysts” are going to use the &#35;CBStoryChallenge as an opportunity to tackle the very complex issue of sanitary dignity for women and girls throughout South Africa.
  body: <p>We see ourselves as “conversation catalysts” for menstrual health management issues relating to sanitary dignity of impoverished girls and women of all races and cultures in South Africa.  For us, the &#35;CBStoryChallenge is an opportunity to tap into the power of technology, new ways in which to tell stories and access to a media network to create awareness.</p><p>The issue of sanitary dignity is a complex – and global – one.  It is definitely a conundrum that deserves attention. There is a lack of clarity on the various agendas driven by key role players (government, NGO’s and activists), where the potential for collaboration is, and how cultural appropriation plays a role in driving solutions that are sustainable in a diverse society like South Africa.  In addition to these factors, conversations about menstrual health are still seen as “dirty” or “taboo”, as an “unimportant” issue, and have not been prioritised by national and local government.</p><p>Through a series of pieces, including blogs, interviews, videos, infographics and conversations, we want to highlight perspective, challenges, opportunities, and gain clarify about the key issues and possible solutions.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, we will focus specifically on the Western Cape in creating awareness and support for existing campaigns, stimulating engaging conversations, understand different perspectives, experiences and look at possible solutions to the conundrum. We will also unpack what local government’s plan and perspective is – all through various ways of storytelling.</p><p>We by no means believe that this will ever be a complexity-free issue and do not expect to find all of the answers.  But we strongly believe in the power of starting conversations, and in those conversations lies a “community of menstrual health champions” who can drive some of the solutions proposed.</p><h4>About us</h4><div class="col-xs-6 sdcu1-left"><p><img class="stupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/sanitary-dignity-conundrum-1.2.jpg"><b>Chani Macauley</b><br>Chani Macauley is passionate about the information and communication tech industry, the entrepreneurial ecosystem, education, and issues relating to humanity and women empowerment.
