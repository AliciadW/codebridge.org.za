  title: Taking a closer look at child headed households in Mpumalanga
  excerpt: "How is it possible that a province as small as Mpumalanga can have so many broken households that have left children without parents? For the #CBStoryChallenge, we aim to interrogate and attempt to understand why this happening." 
  body: <p>We aim to take a closer look at the current situation affecting child headed households in Mpumalanga. The beautiful province of Mpumalanga is a small but picturesque province in South Africa and is well-known for world famous tourist attractions such as the Kruger National Park. But outside the picture perfect scenes, the province has a devastating amount of child headed households. According to Wazimaps, more than 10% of all child headed households in South Africa, are situated in Mpumalanga. How is it possible that such a small province can have so many broken households that have left children without parents?</p><p>From a recent interview with a child headed household, the plight of these sometimes large families made up entirely of helpless children, various social issues that affect them came to light. One being employment. The 17-year old girl who has to take care of five siblings, lied to the owner of a tavern about her age to get a job that keeps her busy from 08:00 to 00:00, day in and day out. Thus leaving her younger siblings to fend for themselves because “someone has to bring home the bacon,” the young girl said.</p><p>The issue of employment does not only affect adults living in South Africa but also children. We plan to look at other issues that affect these fragile households such as&#58;</p><ul><li>Health – does HIV/Aids affect them and how?</li><li>Education – Whilst students at various universities in the country are making their case for free education, what chances of getting any education do members of a child headed household have?</li><li>Accommodation – Are these individuals left with a mere shack? What condition is their shelter in? Does this meet all their needs?</li><li>Crime – Without a parental figure in the households, are these individuals easy targets for criminals or not? How does crime affect them?</li><li>Income/grants – Do these households benefit from government grants or donations from the private sector? What are their monthly/daily expenses? Are they surviving on the money they get or do they have to resort to alternative means to get additional income?</li><li>Society at large – How does society perceive these child headed households? Are they accepted by all or rejected? Does their community/church/elders turn a blind eye to their suffering or are they being supported?</li><li>Relationship with siblings – We would like to have a look at the relationship that exists between siblings. How do the younger ones perceive the eldest and vice versa? Do they respect one another or go about doing their own thing?</li><li>Transport – How do people with little or no income go about using transport? We want to investigate how far it is that these individuals have to travel to get to schools, a supermarket or clinics, for example.</li><li>Basic services – With water being a priority in South Africa following a devastating drought, we would like to have a look at how basic services affect child headed households. Do they have access to clean, running water or do they have to fetch water on a daily basis?</li></ul><p>Our end goal is to raise awareness around the dire situation these child headed households find themselves in as to get the community more involved in their lives and to assist them where necessary. We hope to get the message across that every child matters, whether they have parents who love them or not.</p><p>We plan to utilise various resources to tell our story. We will start with identifying child headed households to interview and then spend a day with each one to ask the burning questions and also to study them. We would like to get firsthand experience of their daily routines and how they go about doing chores without the assistance of an adult. Then we will get comment from professional bodies and associations and try to come up with a solution for this problem. We will also make use of various data tools that have been made available to us via Codebridge to compare the situation in Mpumalanga with that of the entire South Africa. This will show readers just how serious the situation is. In a world with so many problems, how does one compare one problem to another? We also want to make use of a 360 camera to show viewers what these informal dwellings look like where the children live. We will make use of video footage, drone footage and photos to further show the ins and outs of these childrens’ lives. A picture says a thousand words and in a video, another thousand words can drive their plight home.</p><p>We hope that with the information that we gathered, to publish our findings and solutions on a website to show others how dire the situation really is. We also hope to add a page to the website where interested parties can be part of the children’s lives. We want to identify each member that we interviewed and write a little about what’s going on in their lives. For example, one child has a school farewell next month and she wishes for a nice dress. By asking interested parties to donate these kind of items instead of cash, will bring a big change to their lives as people will be donating ‘chances’. By ‘chances’ we mean opportunities to live life and to do things that normal children would.</p><p>We believe that the best gift one can give another is an opportunity/chance to have a full life. This way we can then also take a photo of the girl in her donated dress so that donors can see where their ‘money’ went and how happy it made the individual.</p><h4>About us</h4><p>We are part of The Write News Agency, a freelance news agency based in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga.</p><p><b>Adéle</b><img class="tsupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/children-raising-children-1.1.jpg"> - Adéle started the company in 2012 with the idea to take things a bit easier after being on the front line of news for nearly eight years.
