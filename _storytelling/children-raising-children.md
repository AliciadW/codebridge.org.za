  title: "Government grants for child-headed households"
  excerpt: "This week the team interviewed one of the most important stakeholders in the child-headed households phenomenon: local government. Freddy Ngobe of the Department of Human Settlement discussed the scope of assistance that government is meant to be providing to these young and vulnerable families." 
  body: <p>The Department of Human Settlement in Mpumalanga is mandated to provide assistance to all vulnerable groups including child-headed homes, orphans, elderly people and people with disabilities by prioritising them in its programmes. According to departmental spokesperson Freddy Ngobe, the Department ensures that allocations of houses are biased towards vulnerable groups.</p><p>Watch the full interview here&#58;</p><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0b0Gx5S-jiybTFKTDBPVmFpWnM/preview" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="480"></iframe>

  title: "Harnessing technology to tell our story"
  excerpt: "Here, the team looks at how they’re going to use new technologies to tell their story. These innovations, they believe, will allow readers to become fully immersed in the story and understand the gravity of the challenges facing child-headed households in Mpumalanga." 
  body: <p><i>By Dale Hes</i><p>One of the most important aspects of the Codebridge Re-imagine Storytelling Challenge is to harness new technologies and apps which are able to add impactful angles to a story. In terms of our “Children Raising Children” feature, these innovations will allow readers to become fully immersed in the story and understand the gravity of the challenges facing child-headed households in Mpumalanga.</p><p>Media Monitoring Africa and Code for South Africa’s Wazimap website provides a new level of clarity on some of the most pressing issues facing South Africa. In our work as journalists, we have recognised the potential of this data journalism tool, and are partnering with the developers to introduce it to newsrooms in Mpumalanga, a province which is a few steps behind the technological revolution. For the storytelling challenge, this Wazimap link provides a clear overview of the province, and the figure of just under 10 000 households headed by children under 18 was what prompted us to undertake this project in the first place&#58; <a href="https://wazimap.co.za/profiles/province-MP-mpumalanga/">https://wazimap.co.za/profiles/province-MP-mpumalanga/</a>. It’s extremely interesting to explore this tool, and you’ll undoubtedly want to peruse the figures of the area you live in.</p><p>Other cutting-edge innovations give a more literal view of the story. We have personally visited several child-headed households and were shocked by the living conditions of these broken families. Giving the readers a visual, first-hand look at these homes is one of the most effective ways to relay our intended message and make the difference that we strive to achieve through our journalism. Having been introduced to 360 degree cameras a few months ago, we were highly impressed by the ability of these gadgets to do exactly that.</p><p>Check out this website to see what we mean&#58; <a href="http://labs.tribune.com.pk/inside-machar-colony/">http://labs.tribune.com.pk/inside-machar-colony/</a> </p><p>We believe that these cameras will be invaluable in portraying what we saw in our visits and ultimately, the realities faced by child-headed households. The fact that footage from 360 degree cameras can now be viewed in virtual reality is even more exciting.</p><p>Drones have become a worldwide phenomenon, used by videographers and photographers to create some of the most spectacular, unique and impactful images yet seen. People such as Johnny Miller from Unequal Scenes have shown the potential of these aircraft to highlight the inequality still rampant in our country&#58; <a href="http://unequalscenes.com/">http://unequalscenes.com/</a>.</p><p>Our hope is to use a drone to give an aerial perspective of the townships in which child-headed households live, to show the distances they have to walk to school, and the undeveloped infrastructure of their often dangerous neighbourhoods.</p><p>In the modern world, journalistic storytelling can (and should) be far more than just a piece of writing and a few photographs, although these obviously still play an essential role in telling stories. But the ability to support these traditional methods with today’s incredible technology can elevate a story to a powerful, much more personal level.</p>

  title: "My house looks like..."
  excerpt: "This past week, the team visited another child-headed household where they found a young family sleeping under a tent where parts of the roof used to be. This same room is used to store dirty dishes and water during the day." 
  body: <p><i>By Adele Schormann</i><p>Many adults today may have fond memories of their fathers climbing onto the roof of their house to fix a leak or making a hole in a wall to hang a picture. Do we ever stop to think what a house may look like if there is no one to assist with upkeep and maintenance of a residence or dwelling?</p><p>This thought hit us like a brick this past week when we visited the home of a child-headed household based in Matsulu, Mpumalanga. The state of this specific family’s house is seriously depleting.</p><p>Talking to the children, we learned that one of their major concerns is the state of their house. The children fear that by next winter, there may be nothing left of their current five bedroom house.</p><p>“Our parents built us a house long before they passed away. We didn’t have money to maintain the house even after they passed away and now every little brick and [piece of] roof is falling apart,” said the eldest of the children. “I wonder if we'll still have a shelter by next winter.”</p><div class="col-xs-12 sdcu1-left sdcu1-right"><img class="ctupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/children-raising-children-4.1.jpg"><i>Photo by Beatrice Shongwe</i></div><p>There are five rooms in the house; one was severely damaged during heavy rains in March 2015. This is where two of the girls sleep and they have been forced to use a tent to replace parts of the roof that were destroyed. This also serves as a dumping ground for dirty dishes and water. The eldest daughter and her baby sleep in the second bedroom, while a third room serves as a sitting room. The fourth and final room used to be a bathroom but is now used as the kitchen.</p><p>Looking at Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, shelter is a basic human need. This most recent visit has in particular left us asking&#58; how is it that young children are being deprived of such as basic need and being made to live like this?</p>

  title: My career shift from a tea lady to a journalist
  excerpt: "This week, Beatrice Shongwe, one of our #CBStoryChallenge team members from Nelspruit, tells her own story of how she landed up in journalism. Beatrice has spent the past few weeks interviewing child-headed households around Mpumalanga and is an integral part of her team, as well as the Write News Agency." 
  body: <p><i>By Beatrice Shongwe</i></p><p>As a Christian child I believe that things don’t always turn out the way you plan but the way God plans. My journey is humbling because I started from humbling beginnings.</p><p>A child I always dreamt of becoming a journalist and religiously followed the local news despite the fact that -- I thought -- my chances of becoming a journalist one day were slim. This didn’t stop me from dreaming. I attended public schools and quickly joined a local acting and debate/poem group to try and advance myself.</p><p>Walls were slowly closing in and my dreams seemed to be fading away, I didn’t know where I needed to go to kick start my career in journalism.</p><p>When I finished matric in 2012, university was not even an option as I fell pregnant. Six months after finishing school I found myself a job as a cleaning/tea lady at a marketing company based in Mbombela.</p><p>Sometimes I would help out at reception and quickly learned how to use a computer and improve my typing skills and usage of the English language.</p><p>I enjoyed working with people and seeing what a big difference a mere cup of tea or coffee could make to their day. This led to my meeting with Adele Schormann (owner of The Write News Agency) – offering her a cup of tea when I could see she needed it most. I approached her and explained my love and passion for journalism and asked if she would grant me the opportunity to work in an actual newsroom. In no time at all I was writing articles and I will never forget the first time one of my articles were published in the Sunday Times (September 2014). Seeing my name in such a prestigious publication, was one of the highlights of my life and I will never forget how I broke out in tears when Adele showed me the newspaper with my name printed in bold.</p><p>Two years later I am still writing articles from my home town, Matsulu and giving a voice to my community. Earlier this year I received a recognition award during the provincial Govan Mbeki Awards for my reportage on the struggle of people to get an RDP house and the maintenance issues and injustice that goes with being granted such a house.</p><p>Starting out as a journalist in Matsulu was not always easy since some folks did not know what a journalist does and how getting one’s story out there for the public to read, can make a difference.</p><p>I am extremely passionate about the project we are currently working on involving child headed households since it is an issue that affects my community and thus affects me. It is my wish that through journalism, solutions to pressing problems may become clear and I look forward to playing my part as the watchdog of Matsulu.</p>

  title: Mother, sister, sole support - and she’s only 17
  excerpt: "This week, the Nelspruit team met up with a 17-year-old girl who is raising her three siblings and has a young son of her own. She works for up to 16 hours a day, meaning that her young family is left alone at home. She is just one of several hundred families who are in a similar situation, and who the team hope to meet over the next month." 
  body: <p>This week we met a 17-year-old girl who is currently the head of her household in Matsulu, Mpumalanga, and is willing to let us interview her and her family. She has three siblings between the ages of eight and 13, as well as a three-year-old son.<p>They live in their family home which was severely damaged during the recent storms; to the point where parts of the roof is missing.</p><p>She had to leave school when she was in Grade 9 after both her parents passed away and started working part-time at a spaza shop. Recently, she found a more permanent position in a local tavern where she works from 8am until midnight every single day. Besides the small salary she gets from working there, the family relies heavily on social grants. When their parents died, the siblings’ relatives cut all ties with them and refused to support them, meaning that sometimes the young family goes without food for up to two days.</p><p>She told us that she is extremely concerned about the safety of her younger siblings and son since she works until midnight and they are left unattended and alone at home. Even though she is struggling to make end’s meet, she does not want to see her younger siblings, whom she “loves dearly”, go to an orphanage.</p><p>She also told us that she gave up on her dream of becoming a nurse in order to take care of her younger siblings and on numerous occasions, counsellors and social workers have made promises to help the family; but to date, no one has made good on their promises.</p><p>In the coming week, we will identify a second child-headed household to interview.</p>

  title: Taking a closer look at child headed households in Mpumalanga
  excerpt: "How is it possible that a province as small as Mpumalanga can have so many broken households that have left children without parents? For the #CBStoryChallenge, we aim to interrogate and attempt to understand why this happening." 
  body: <p>We aim to take a closer look at the current situation affecting child headed households in Mpumalanga. The beautiful province of Mpumalanga is a small but picturesque province in South Africa and is well-known for world famous tourist attractions such as the Kruger National Park. But outside the picture perfect scenes, the province has a devastating amount of child headed households. According to Wazimaps, more than 10% of all child headed households in South Africa, are situated in Mpumalanga. How is it possible that such a small province can have so many broken households that have left children without parents?</p><p>From a recent interview with a child headed household, the plight of these sometimes large families made up entirely of helpless children, various social issues that affect them came to light. One being employment. The 17-year old girl who has to take care of five siblings, lied to the owner of a tavern about her age to get a job that keeps her busy from 08:00 to 00:00, day in and day out. Thus leaving her younger siblings to fend for themselves because “someone has to bring home the bacon,” the young girl said.</p><p>The issue of employment does not only affect adults living in South Africa but also children. We plan to look at other issues that affect these fragile households such as&#58;</p><ul><li>Health – does HIV/Aids affect them and how?</li><li>Education – Whilst students at various universities in the country are making their case for free education, what chances of getting any education do members of a child headed household have?</li><li>Accommodation – Are these individuals left with a mere shack? What condition is their shelter in? Does this meet all their needs?</li><li>Crime – Without a parental figure in the households, are these individuals easy targets for criminals or not? How does crime affect them?</li><li>Income/grants – Do these households benefit from government grants or donations from the private sector? What are their monthly/daily expenses? Are they surviving on the money they get or do they have to resort to alternative means to get additional income?</li><li>Society at large – How does society perceive these child headed households? Are they accepted by all or rejected? Does their community/church/elders turn a blind eye to their suffering or are they being supported?</li><li>Relationship with siblings – We would like to have a look at the relationship that exists between siblings. How do the younger ones perceive the eldest and vice versa? Do they respect one another or go about doing their own thing?</li><li>Transport – How do people with little or no income go about using transport? We want to investigate how far it is that these individuals have to travel to get to schools, a supermarket or clinics, for example.</li><li>Basic services – With water being a priority in South Africa following a devastating drought, we would like to have a look at how basic services affect child headed households. Do they have access to clean, running water or do they have to fetch water on a daily basis?</li></ul><p>Our end goal is to raise awareness around the dire situation these child headed households find themselves in as to get the community more involved in their lives and to assist them where necessary. We hope to get the message across that every child matters, whether they have parents who love them or not.</p><p>We plan to utilise various resources to tell our story. We will start with identifying child headed households to interview and then spend a day with each one to ask the burning questions and also to study them. We would like to get firsthand experience of their daily routines and how they go about doing chores without the assistance of an adult. Then we will get comment from professional bodies and associations and try to come up with a solution for this problem. We will also make use of various data tools that have been made available to us via Codebridge to compare the situation in Mpumalanga with that of the entire South Africa. This will show readers just how serious the situation is. In a world with so many problems, how does one compare one problem to another? We also want to make use of a 360 camera to show viewers what these informal dwellings look like where the children live. We will make use of video footage, drone footage and photos to further show the ins and outs of these childrens’ lives. A picture says a thousand words and in a video, another thousand words can drive their plight home.</p><p>We hope that with the information that we gathered, to publish our findings and solutions on a website to show others how dire the situation really is. We also hope to add a page to the website where interested parties can be part of the children’s lives. We want to identify each member that we interviewed and write a little about what’s going on in their lives. For example, one child has a school farewell next month and she wishes for a nice dress. By asking interested parties to donate these kind of items instead of cash, will bring a big change to their lives as people will be donating ‘chances’. By ‘chances’ we mean opportunities to live life and to do things that normal children would.</p><p>We believe that the best gift one can give another is an opportunity/chance to have a full life. This way we can then also take a photo of the girl in her donated dress so that donors can see where their ‘money’ went and how happy it made the individual.</p><h4>About us</h4><p>We are part of The Write News Agency, a freelance news agency based in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga.</p><p><b>Adéle</b><img class="tsupdate-image" src="/storytelling/img/children-raising-children-1.1.jpg"> - Adéle started the company in 2012 with the idea to take things a bit easier after being on the front line of news for nearly eight years.
