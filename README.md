codebridge.org.za
=================

This website is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with a [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework, and is hosted by Github that points to a custom domain. We welcome any and all contributions, be sure to check out if there are any pending [issues](https://github.com/codebridge-za/codebridge-za.github.io/issues).

## Getting started
### Jekyll

Once you've cloned a copy of the git, open a terminal from the project's directory  and type the following:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:4000` to preview the site. If you're new to Jekyll (or Ruby), you'll need to follow their simple [installation guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

## codebridge.co.za

codebridge.co.za is moving to codebridge.org.za. To facilitate this, we're serving redirects to codebridge.org.za. codebridge.co.za is serving from the gh-pages branch just in case someone accidentally pushes changes intended for condebridge.org.za to the old remote.
