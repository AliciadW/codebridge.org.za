        <h2>Planning Meetup</h2>
        <p>As many of you might by now already know Josh Yudaken is planning on leaving Cape Town mid-August. We would like to keep codebridge alive if possible, but need to work out plans.</p>

        <p>We'll be discussing everything, and the event is open to anyone who cares to join. At some point if the meeting carries on we'll probably order take-aways, or perhaps go somewhere for dinner if we finish early.</p>

        <p>This event is open to everyone in the Cape Town tech community</p>

        <p>If you would like to RSVP to this event via Facebook, there is an event page at: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/524071607646091">https://www.facebook.com/events/524071607646091</a></p>
