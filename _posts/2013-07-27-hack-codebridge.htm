<h2>Hack {code}bridge (Saturday, 27th July 2013 from 11am)</h2>

<p>We're pushing to get the development of {code}bridge moving forward, with
   the aim of eventually being the ideal space for startups and like-minded
   hackers (software and hardware) in Cape Town.</p>

 <p>There is a lot to get done, on the agenda for Saturday is:<br/>
   * Getting consitution written for NPO ( it seems like the best way forward )
   * Setting up electronic access control for the front door ( we have an arduino with an rfid reader )<br/>
   * Writing up content and designing a better website<br/>
   * Building the two unfinished tables that are still sitting here<br/>
   * Re-wiring and chatting more about codebridges future</p>

<p>There will be beer, pizza, and a whole lot of hackers.</p>
