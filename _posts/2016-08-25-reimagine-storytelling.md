We have moved into the digital and information age. This means that the way we tell stories has evolved from just telling them to getting the reader involved. This is what Re-Imagine Storytelling is all about. It brings together elements of data, tech, journalism and activism. It goes beyond just reporting issues of social justice to actively trying to solve them.

Codebridge challenges journalists, developers, students, activists, economists - pretty much anyone who wants to tell a story - to submit your innovative project idea and potentially change South Africa with a story. By identifying a community who has a gap that needs to be filled or problem solved, your idea will be a project in storytelling, activism and community engagement. Storytellers will be partnered with nonprofit and community-development organisations, and projects will consist of across-the-board collaboration.

Tell us what your innovation is, the issue you’d like to tackle and the story you’re going to tell. You can make an app, build a tool, create a campaign or invent something that no one has ever thought of, so long as it tells a story. By joining the challenge, you’ll become a part of the Codebridge community and be able to take your project even further.

Teams will compete for a cash prize of R20,000 and all projects are guaranteed a small budget to work with, Codebridge resources, a cool space where you can plot, plan and create, as well as media coverage.

Entries will open next Thursday, September 1 and will close on Tuesday, September 13.

Teams must be available to attend an open pitch session on September 6 in Cape Town or September 13 in Durban (depending on where you and the organisation you’d like to work with are based), as well as workshops, training, research, planning and check-in sessions throughout.
