<h2>Planning Meetup (Thursday, 11th July 2013 - 6:30pm)</h2>
<p>As many of you might by now already know Josh Yudaken is planning on leaving Cape Town mid-August. We would like to keep codebridge alive if possible, but need to work out plans.</p>

<p>We'll be discussing everything, and the event is open to anyone who cares to join. At some point if the meeting carries on we'll probably order take-aways, or perhaps go somewhere for dinner if we finish early.</p>

<p>This event is open to everyone in the Cape Town tech community</p>
