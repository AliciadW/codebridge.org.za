- eventtype: Dataquest
  description: Dataquests are an opportunity for teams to work on a specific problem surfaced from an accountability workshop.
                These could range from story angels, interesting visualisations to prototype apps which could be further developed either through mentorship opportunities or via community evenings.

- eventtype: Movie Evening
  description: A movie evening is a casual, informative evening where members gather to watch an informative film aligned to interesting social issues, share some popcorn and a drink and learn more about each other and the society we live in.

- eventtype: Community Evening
  description: Community nights are a chance for the Codebridge community to get together and work on projects. 
              The idea is to create a space that people know will be open and available on a regular basis and instill a culture of working on pet projects or finding a project to work on.
              On the odd occasion we might have a guest speaker doing a quick chat, but nothing too formal.
              People are free to arrive when they can and stay as long as they can.

- eventtype: Data Viz Meetup
  description: Data viz meetups take a show-and-tell format. We encourage people to share what they have been working on and want to showcase and encourage discussion around data viz best practises.

- eventtype: Accountability Workshop
  description: Accountability workshops aim to understand a specific problem space, as guided by the monthly theme. We invite CSOs and other members of society who feel strongly about the theme, or understand the theme, to share their learnings and experience with us through a facilitated workshop.
               These findings are prioritised as a group and put forward for future hackathon/dataquests as well as available community projects.
               In addition, participants are encouraged to champion a project through to completion.
