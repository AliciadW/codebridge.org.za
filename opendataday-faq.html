          <h2 class="odd17-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <h3 class="odd17-subtitle">I want to host a dataquest in my community. What do I do?</h3>
          <p>Great stuff! First, go to this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/fk0nlKyIIURhCexg2" target="_blank">Google form</a> and register your event. Once your event is confirmed, you will be emailed a link to the Host Pack and your event will be listed on the Know Your Hood[link to page] event page.</p>

          <h3 class="odd17-subtitle">I’ve never hosted an event before. What do I do?</h3>
          <p>Don’t worry, it’s pretty simple. For a Dataquest,</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Secure a venue with wifi, and that people are able to connect their devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones - even one per group is enough), to access the data. Local libraries are great options - or check with NGOs or small businesses who have premises in the area and are will to come on board.</li>
            <li>It’s a good idea to look through the tools before the event, so you have time to ask us any questions before the event. The questions will be released at 9am on 04 March, to give everyone a fair chance, but you’re free to play around with the tools (see below) as much as possible before and after.</li>
            <li>Get the word out. The Host Pack will contain some templates for invitations and logos for a poster. Fill in your event details (venue, time, contact details) and share on Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Email - wherever your networks are. </li>
          </ol>

          <h3 class="odd17-subtitle">What if participants are from different communities?</h3>
          <p>No problem! It’s an online challenge, and the data represents the whole country, so participants can choose any community they want.</p>
          
          <h3 class="odd17-subtitle">I can't host an event, but would love to participat.</h3>
          <p>It’s an online challenge and open to everyone, even individuals. Sign up <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/LldtL7Wiw3eorgBv1" target="_blank">here</a> and we’ll make sure you have everything you need on the day.</p>

          <h3 class="odd17-subtitle">I don't know Excel or spreadsheets. How can I work with data?</h3>
          <p>You don’t need experience with spreadsheets to take this challenge. We have some cool, easy to use online tools that presents the data in an easy to understand way, much like most of the mobile apps you use. Think of them as a ‘TV-Guide’ for your community information.</p>
          <p>You can check them out now.</p>

          </ul>

          <h3 class="odd17-subtitle">Do we win anything?</h3>
          <p>Well, it’s not a competition, but there is something at the end of the quest. While the big win for us is communities knowing more about their community, there are TWO R2000 prizes up for grabs for two individuals or teams.</p>

          <h3 class="odd17-subtitle">Anything else?</h3>
          <p>We’re to help. If you’ve got any other questions, email us at community@code4sa.org</p>
