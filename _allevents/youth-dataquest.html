		<p>It’s #YouthMonth and we’re hosting a dataquest to interrogate youth issues and hack practical, actionable solutions to the struggles that young South Africans are facing today.
           
        <p>Join us as we form teams around actionable stories or projects that speak to youth issues.
        <h4>A bit of background</h4>
		<p>On the 22 June 2016, Codebridge in partnership with <a href="http://livityafrica.com/">Livity Africa</a>, hosted a Youth Accountability Workshop with civil society organisations in Cape Town to unpack the critical challenges faced by South African youth today and identify possible solutions. These challenges and potential solutions will be used to frame the dataquest. Please explore and familiarise yourself with the focus areas.

		<h4><i class="fa fa-bullseye" aria-hidden="true"></i> Focus Areas</h4>
		  <h5 style="color:#AB1B1B">Lack of sanitary products </h5>
           <h6>Problems</h6>
            <ul>
			 <li>Who is affected: young schoolgirls, unemployed women and street women.</li>
             <li>On average, girls who don’t have access to sanitary products miss 60 days of school annually.</li>
             <li>Girls don’t have access to safe sanitary products – pads and tampons – and often have to use leaves, rags and newspapers that results in infections and poor hygiene.</li>
             <li>The money for this is available, but government departments cannot decide who should take ownership: Department of Basic Education, Department of Health, Department of Social Development, Women in the Presidency</li>
            </ul> 
           <h6>Solutions</h6>
            <ul>
             <li>Educational drives at schools to talk about menstruation, etc, perhaps by a community member.</li>
             <li>Sister schools program: where wealthier schools donate products to less advantaged schools every month.</li>
             <li>Getting government to partner with existing NGOs who are already doing this work, eg: Dignity Dreams, and offer funding and support to them to widen their reach.</li>
            </ul> 
          <h5 style="color:#AB1B1B">Lack of role models</h5>
           <h6>Problems</h6>
            <ul>
             <li>Intercity migration for work might be a reason why a parent, older brother or sister isn’t available.</li>
             <li>Teenage pregnancy often takes someone out of the home of leaves a child behind with grandparents or other family member.</li>
             <li>Where parents may be very wealthy, they often have to work a lot to maintain that lifestyle.</li>
            </ul>
           <h6>Solutions</h6>
            <ul>
             <li>Use community centres to create mentoring and opportunity spaces for youth.</li>
             <li>Communities can be anywhere: in the home, at work, at school. We can provide/increase support in existing structures. </li>
             <li>Build communities around you – by becoming involved in your colleague or neighbours around us, we can be role models to youth in those spaces.</li>
            </ul>
          <h5 style="color:#AB1B1B">Lack of safe spaces and recreational activities</h5>
           <h6>Problems</h6>
            <ul>
             <li>Community centres often hire out their spaces for income and prioritise paid events, so youth do not have access to this space.</li>
             <li>Bureaucracy and red rape stands in the way of creating new or more safe spaces.</li>
             <li>Communities are often resistant to and suspicious of stakeholders from other areas who want to create safe spaces in the community.</li>
            </ul>
           <h6>Solutions</h6>
            <ul>
             <li>There are safe spaces, but youth are not interested in them. We need to repackage and market these program in ways that are more attractive, the way corporates do. </li>
             <li>A space doesn’t have to be physical – virtual spaces (MXIT, Whatsapp groups, Etc) can be safe spaces for youth to talk about difficult issues.</li>
            </ul>
