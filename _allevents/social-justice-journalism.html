        The <a href="/reimagine-storytelling.html">Codebridge Re-imagine Storytelling Challenge</a> goes beyond simply reporting the facts and instead, is aimed at finding long-term and sustainable ways of empowering communities, and inevitably driving social change. With this in mind, weâ€™re having an <i>Evening of Social Justice Journalism</i>. This event is open to anyone, but participants of the Storytelling Challenge are encouraged to be there, as this forms part of the training and workshop series.

How does one go about telling a story in this context? What level of impact can storytelling have on local communities? What role do we, as storytellers, play?
