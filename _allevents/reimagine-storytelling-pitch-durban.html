			Anyone interested in entering the Storytelling challenge, as well as any organisations who want to take part, are encouraged to join us. Read our <a href="/2016-08-25/reimagine-storytelling.htm">blog post</a> for more information about the challenge. 
			</p>
			<p>If you missed out on the launch of our Storytelling Challenge - or even if you were there - then join us for a follow-up event. The open pitch session will be a chance to pin down your story idea, come up with one if you haven't already and find a team. You'll also get to test out your pitch, see what others think and meet some of the people at Codebridge who will be helping out the eight competing teams throughout the challenge. This is not a formal pitch, so teams and individuals do not need to come prepared with presentations.</p>
