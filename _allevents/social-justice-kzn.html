        Join us this Thursday for An Evening of Social Justice couch session, with journalist Sam Sole, the managing partner at the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism. Storytelling challengers are strongly encouraged to attend, but the session is open to anyone interested.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Sole has written many stories on issues of social justice and has experienced the challenges of putting a story together, writing for different platforms and using a variety of different elements in a story. At this session, we want to give writers and non-writers the opportunity to ask questions to help them with their own story ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us this Thursday (22 September) in Durban and be inspired to bring your own story idea to life!
