        It has been three weeks since the launch of the Codebridge Re-imagine Storytelling Challenge. We have received great story ideas from all over the country – it doesn’t matter where you are based, if you have a story idea that you would like to enter, we encourage you to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we delve deeper into the challenge, we have several events lined up. The first is a couch session with journalist Sam Sole, who is managing partner at the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism. Storytelling challengers are strongly encouraged to attend, but the session is open to anyone interested.  
      </p>

        Sole has written many stories on issues of social justice and has experienced the challenges of putting a story together, writing for different platforms and using a variety of different elements in a story. At this session, we want to give writers and non-writers the opportunity to ask questions to help them with their own story ideas. This session will no doubt inspire everyone by showing the impact a story can have when it is taken further than merely reporting the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        So join us this Thursday (22 September) in Durban and be inspired to bring your own story idea to life!
