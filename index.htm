<h1>What is Codebridge?</h1>
<p>
    We're a small co-working space and developer community center in Cape Town.
    It's an attempt at building a small startup hub focused entirely on the 
    technical end of the spectrum. The entire concept is heavily based on the
    successful <a href="http://wiki.hackerdojo.com/w/page/25437/FrontPage">Hacker Dojo</a>
    space in Mountain View, CA.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have a membership fee of R300 - R800, which will get you a key to the building
    and the ability to use the event space downstairs as long as no-one else has 
    booked it.
  </p>
  <ul></ul>

    * For general matters, join our 
    <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codebridge">public mailing list</a>.<br/>

<h2>Sponsors</h2>
  <p>
    We are very grateful to be sponsored by <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>
    who cover the rent of the building.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our current internet sponsor is <a href="http://www.snapbill.com">SnapBill</a>, though
    we're always looking for an upgrade. (did someone say fibre?)

<h2>Donations</h2>

  <p>
    The income membership fee is enough to cover the basics, but we survive off 
    donations.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Desks and chairs: </strong><br/>
      We have had a fair amount of desks and chairs donated already, but we're 
      always looking for more. Really anything goes - old plastic chairs are
      very useful for overflow seating at events.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Programming books: </strong><br/>
      It would be great to build up a collection of programming books. We've
      always looking for more. Feel free to swap any of the books on the 
      shelf with one from your home (but please bring it back after a while.)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Whiteboards: </strong><br/>
      It seems we can never have enough. We ideally want some large wall sized ones,
      but the smaller ones are useful too.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Projector: </strong><br/>
      We're currently have a plan to borrow a projector for most events, but it
      would be great to have our own.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Your time:</strong><br/>
      Since we're entirely member-run there are whole lot of random jobs
      to do around the building (you know - taking out trash, etc.). This 
      website also needs some work (and 
      <a href="https://github.com/codebridge-za/codebridge-za.github.io">its on github!</a>)
