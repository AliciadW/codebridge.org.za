<h2>Local Budget Dataquest</h2>
<h4><span class="label label-success">23 April 2016</span></h4>
<p>Government budgets are a blueprint for how public resources are going to be used in order to satisfy public needs. Transparent budgets, expenditure and revenues, and other financial data enable people to access information on the sources of revenue and understand how that money is spent.</p>

<p>The National Treasury through its City Support Programme is seeking to open municipal financial data and make it widely available in order to strengthen civic oversight and public accountability as well as to promote entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>We love open data! And so, we are assisting the National Treasury in the process and want to get you involved too.</p>

<h4>Join us for a dataquest!</h4>
<p>We are looking for data visualisations, stories and app ideas/prototypes, using this local municipal budget information. This means we are looking for individuals from various background with a range of skill sets to come collaborate and delve into this data.</p>
<p>We are having three Local Municipal Budget Workshops on 12 April 2016, in different cities, to define the focus areas for this project. More info on this to follow after the events.</p>
<p>In the meantime <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jvRT3vZl1AJCMRdtacskXxqzLnV0ntNSKzgMW1ThlWY/viewform" target="_blank">RSVP your attendance</a>.</p>
<p>We look forward to spending the day with you!</p>
